### Hey! I'm [@Villy15](https://github.com/Villy15) (Adrian Villanueva) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Philippines. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ 

I enjoy building applications focused on business-driven outcomes. My toolset includes SQL, NoSQL, Docker, Python, TypeScript (and JavaScript), modern backend APIs (like Express.js and FastAPI), and cross-platform mobile frameworks (like React Native and Flutter).

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to for my capstone project in my school. At the same time, I am also upskilling by learning AWS to hopefully earn a certificate. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to **contact me**. ðŸ¤“
